                Layer chickens are a special species of hens, which want to 
                be raised from when they are one day old and they start 
                laying eggs commercially from 18 to 19 weeks of age. 
                They remain to lay eggs continuously till their 72 to 78 weeks 
                of age. They can generate about one kg of eggs by consuming 
                about 2.25 kg of food during their egg-laying period. 
                To produce a hybrid egg layer, consider the different 
                characteristics of cock and hen before breeding. 
                There are different types of highly egg productive layer 
                breeds available throughout the world.

                Eggs are laid by female animals of many different species, including 
                birds, reptiles, amphibians, a few mammals, and fish, and many of 
                these have been eaten by humans for thousands of years. Bird and 
                reptile eggs consist of a protective eggshell, albumen (egg white), 
                and vitellus (egg yolk), contained within various thin membranes. 
                The most commonly consumed eggs are chicken eggs. Other poultry eggs 
                including those of duck and quail also are eaten.

                Eggs are the official star VIP at our breakfast table 
                â€” there are so many reasons why we love them. They're cheap, 
                always versatile, and most of all, they're chock full of 
                good-for-you protein, making them a fantastic choice to supercharge 
                your morning. But while home cooks factor eggs into their shopping 
                budget and nearly always enjoy their protein boost, 
                some may be still searching for inspiration on new ways to regularly 
                enjoy them. If you're looking to break out of your scrambled-eggs-and-bacon shell, 
                you'll want to try one of these equally delicious and easy egg dishes.
